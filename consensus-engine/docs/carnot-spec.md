# Carnot Specification
This is the pseudocode specification of the Carnot consensus algorithm.
In this specification we will omit any cryptographic material, block validity and proof checks. A real implementation is expected to check those before hitting this code.

'Q:' is used to indicate unresolved questions.
Notation is loosely based on CDDL.

## Messages
A critical piece in the protocol, these are the different kind of messages used by participants during the protocol execution.
* `Block`: propose a new block
* `Vote`: vote for a block proposal
* `NewView`: propose to jump to a new view after a proposal for the current one was not received before a configurable timeout.


### Block
(sometimes also called proposal)
```
view: View
qc: Qc
``` 
We assume an unique identifier of the block can be obtained, for example by hashing its contents. We will use the `id()` function to access the identifier of the current block.
We also assume that a unique tree order of blocks can be determined, and in particular each participant can identify the parent of each block. We will use the `parent()` function to access such parent block.
        
##### View
```
view_n: uint
```
a monotonically increasing number (considerations about the size?)

##### Qc
There are currently two different types of QC:
```
Qc = Standard / Aggregate
```

###### Standard
```
view: View
block: Id
```
Q: there can only be one block on which consensus in achieved for a view, so maybe the block field is redundant?

###### Aggregate
```
view: View
high_qc: Qc
```
`high_qc` is `Qc` for the most recent view among the aggregated ones. The rest of the qcs are ignored in the rest of this algorithm.

We assume there is a  `block` function available that returns the block for the Qc. In case of a standard qc, this is trivially qc.block, while for aggregate it can be obtained by recusively accessing `high_qc` until a standard qc is found.


##### Id
undef, will assume a 32-byte opaque string

### Vote
A vote for `block` in `view`
```      
block: Id
view: View 
voter: Id
? qc: Qc
```
qc is the optional field containing the QC built by root nodes from 2/3 + 1 votes from their child committees and forwarded the the next view leader.

### NewView
```
view: View
high_qc: Qc
```
### viewSynchMsg

view: View
newViewQC: Qc

## Local Variables
Participants in the protocol are expected to mainting the following data in addition to the DAG of received proposal:
* `current_view`
* `local_high_qc`
* `latest_committed_view`
* `collection`: TODO rename


## Available Functions
The following functions are expected to be available to participants during the execution of the protocol:
* `leader(view)`: returns the leader of the view.
* `reset_timer()`: resets timer. If the timer expires the `timeout` routine is triggered.
* `extends(block, ancestor)`: returns true if block is descendant of the ancestor in the chain.

* `download(view)`: Download missing block for the view.
     getMaxViewQC(qcs): returns the qc with the highest view number.
* `member_of_leaf_committee()`: returns true if the participant executing the function is in the leaf committee of the committee overlay.

* `member_of_root_com()`: returns true if the participant executing the function is member of the root committee withing the tree overlay.

* `member_of_internal_com()`: returns truee if the participant executing the function is member of internal committees within the committee tree overlay

* `child_committee(participant)`: returns true if the participant passed as argument is member of the child committee of the participant executing the function.

* `supermajority(votes)`: the behavior changes with the position of a participant in the overlay:
    * Root committee: returns if the number of distinctive signers of votes for a block in the child committee is equal to the threshold.

* `leader_supermajority(votes)`: returns if the number of distinct voters for a block is 2/3 + 1 for both children committees of root committee and overall 2/3 + 1

* `morethanSsupermajority(votes)`: returns if the number of distinctive signers of votes for a block is is more than the threshold: TODO
* `parent_committe`: return the parent committee of the participant executing the function withing the committee tree overlay. Result is undefined if called from a participant in the root committee.


<!-- #####Supermajority of child votes is 2/3 +1 votes from members of child committees
#####Supermajority for the qc to be included in the block, should have at least 2/3+1 votes from both children of the root committee and overal 2/3 +1
#####combined votes of the root committee+its child committees. -->



## Core functions
These are the core functions necessary for the Carnot consensus protocol, to be executed in response of incoming messages, except for `timeout` which is triggered by a participant configurable timer.     
     
### Receive block
```Ruby
Func receive_block(block):
    if block.id() is known OR block.view <= latest_committed_block {
        return
    }

    # Recursively make sure that we process blocks in order
    if block.parent() is missing { 
        let parent = download(block.parent)
        receive(parent)
    }

    if safe_block(block){
        # Q: This is not in the original spec, but 
        # let's validate I have this clear.
        assert block.view = current_view

        update_higQC(block.qc)

        if member_of_leaf_committee() {
            let vote = create_vote()
            if member_of_root_committee() {
                send(vote, leader(current_view + 1))
            } else {
                send(vote, parent_committee())
            }

            current_view = current_view + 1
            reset_timer()
            try_to_commit_grandparent(block)
        }
    }
}
```
##### Auxiliary functions
```Ruby
Func safeBlock(block){
    match block.qc {
        Standard => {
            # Previous leader did not fail and its proposal was certified
            # Q: not a fan of the comment above
            if block.qc.view <= latest_committed_view {
                return false;
            }

            # this check makes sure block is not old 
            # and the previous leader did not fail
            return block.view >= current_view
                AND block.view == block.qc.view + 1
        }

        Aggregate => {
            # Verification of block.aggQC.highQC along 
            # with signature or block.aggQC.signature is sufficient.
            # No need to verify each qc inside block.aggQC
            if block.qc.high_qc.view <= latest_committed_view {
                return false;
            }

            return block.view >= curView
                AND extends(block, block.aggQC.high_qc.block)
            # Q: is block.aggQc.high_qc.block the same as block.parent()?
            # This would suggest this check is redundant
        }
    }

}
```
```Ruby
# Commit a grand parent if the grandparent and 
# the parent have been added during two consecutive views.
Func try_to_commit_grandparent(block){ 
    parent = block.parent()
    grandparent = parent.parent()
    return parent.view = grandparent.view+1
        AND block.qc is Standard # Q: Is this necessary?
        AND parent.qc is Standard # Q: Is this necessary?
    # Update last_committed_view
}
```

```Ruby
# Update the latest certification (qc)
Func update_high_qc(qc){
    match qc {
        # Happy case
        Standard => {
            # TODO: revise
            if qc.view > local_high_qc.view{
                local_high_qc = qc
            }

            # Q: The original pseudocde checked for possilbly
            # missing view and downloaded them, but I think
            # we already dealt with this in receive_block
        }
        # Unhappy case
        Agregate => {
            # Q: TODO revisit when highQc.block is clear
            if qc.high_qc.view != local_high_qc.view {
                # release the lock and adopt the global lock (?)
                local_high_qc = qc.high_qc
                # Q: same thing about missing views
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Receive Vote
Q: this whole function needs to be revised
```Ruby

Func receive_vote(vote){ 
    if vote.block is missing { 
        let block = download(vote.block)
        receive(block)
    }
    # Q: What's this condition for?
    if vote.view < current_view - 1 { 
        return
    }

    # Q: we should probably return if we already received this vote

    if member_of_internal_com() AND not member_of_root() {
        if childcommittee (vote.voter) {
            collection[vote.block].append(vote)
        } else {
            # Q: not returning here would mean it's extremely easy to
            # trigger building a new vote in the following branches
            return;
        }

        if supermajority(collection[vote.block]){
            # Q: should we send it to everyone in the committe?
            let self_vote = build_vote();
            send(self_vote, parentCommittee)
            # Q: why here?
            current_view += 1;
            reset_timer()
            # Q: why do we do this here? 
            try_to_commit_grandparent(block)
        }
    }

    if member_of_root(){
        if childcommittee(vote.voter) { 
            collection[vote.block].append(vote)
        } else {
            # Q: not returning here would mean it's extremely easy to
            # trigger building a new vote in the following branches
            return;
        }

        # Q: Same consideration as above
        if supermajority(collection[vote.block]){
            # Q: The vote to send is not the one received but
            # the one build by this participant, right?
            let self_vote = build_vote();
            qc = build_qc(collection[vote.block])
            self_vote.qc=qc
            send(self_vote, leader(current_view + 1))
            # Q: why here?
            current_view += 1
            reset_timer()
            # Q: why here?
            try_to_commit_grandparent(block)
        }

        # Q: this means that we send a message for every incoming
        # message after the threshold has been reached, i.e. a vote
        # from a node in the leaf committee can trigger
        # at least height(tree) messages.
        if morethanSsupermajority(collection[vote.block]) {
            # just forward the vote to the leader
            # Q: But then childcommitte(vote.voter) would return false
            # in the leader, as it's a granchild, not a child
            send(vote, leader(current_view + 1))
        }
    }

    if self = leader(view) {
        # Q: No filtering? I can just create a key and  vote?
        collection[vote.block].append(vote)
        if supermajority(collection[vote.block]){
            qc = build_qc(collection[vote.block])
            block = build_block(qc)
            broadcast(block)
        }
    }
}
```

### Receive NewView
```Ruby
# Failure Case
Func receive(newView) {
    # download the missing block 
    if newview.highQC.block missing {
        let block = download(new_view.high_qc.block)
        receive(block)
    }

    # It's an old message. Ignore it.
    if newView.view < current_view {
        return 
    }

    # Q: this was update_high_qc_and_view(new_view.high_qc, Null)
    update_high_qc(new_view.high_qc)

    if member_of_internal_com() {
        collection[newView.view].append(newView)
        if supermajority[newView.view]{
            newViewQC=buildQC(collection[newView.view])
            if member_of_root(){
                send(newViewQC, leader(view+1))
                curView++
            } else {
                send(newViewQC, parent_committee())
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Timeout
```Ruby
Func timeout(){
        cur_view++
        reset()
                if (member_of_internal_com() AND not member_of_root()) OR member_of_leaf {
                        let newView = create_newView()
                        send(newView, parent_committee())
                 
                }
                if member_of_root() {
                        let newView = creat_newView()
                        send(newView,root_committee()) # Need to be discussed. It can only be sent to the next leader but since the RB needs agreement to generate the seed for the leader+overlay, therefore newView is sent to the root_committee().

                }
}
``` 
### Forwarding newViewQC
```Ruby
Func receive(newViewQC){
         if (member_of_internal_com() AND not member_of_root()) OR member_of_leaf {
                send(newViewQC,parent_committee())
         }
          if member_of_root() {
                     send(newViewQC,leader(view+1))
          }
          if leader(){
                 let viewSynchMsg = create_viewSynchMsg(newViewQC)
                 broadcast(viewSynchMsg)
          }
        
}
